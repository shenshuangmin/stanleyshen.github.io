## How to get environment from another freestype job

We have a case that we need to get an UUID from a freestyple job.

```
UUID="aaa-bbb-ccc-ddd"
echo "BOOTSTRAP_UUID=${UUID}" > package.properties
```

And inject environment variabls based on this properties file.

In pipeline job, we will build this job and get UUID from it.

```
def job = null
node("docker-slave") {
   stage('test3') {
    job = build job: 'sleep60'
   } 
   
   println job.getRawBuild().getEnvironment()["BOOTSTRAP_UUID"]
   println Jenkins.instance.getItemByFullName("sleep60").getAllJobs()[0].getLastSuccessfulBuild().getEnvironment()["BOOTSTRAP_UUID"]
}
```
* We need to uncheck "Use Groovy Sandbox", otherwise these methods can not be invoked duce permission issue.
