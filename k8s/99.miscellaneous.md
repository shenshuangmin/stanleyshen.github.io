### How to list images and containers in k8s
We can point docker client to the VM's docker daemon by running

```
eval $(minikube docker-env)
```

Then we can build image normally and create your kubernetes resources normally using kubectl.
Make sure you have

```
imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
```
in your YAML or JSON spec.

Additionally, we can set a flag to minikube VM for insecure registries, but this must be specified the first time you create the machine.

```
minikube start --insecure-registry
```


### apps/v1beta1 VS extensions/v1beta1
`apps` API group will be where the v1 Deployment type lives. The `apps/v1beta1` version was added in 1.6.0, so if you have a 1.5.x client or server, you should still use the `extensions/v1beta1` version.

The `apps/v1beta1` and `extensions/v1beta1` Deployment types are identical, but when creating via the apps API, some improved defaults are used
