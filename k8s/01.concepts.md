# Key concepts to kubernets

Kubernets is an open source orchestration system for Docker containers. It manages containerized applications accross multiple hosts and provides basic mechanisms for deployment, maintenance and scaling of applications.

It allows the user to provide declarative primitives for the desired state, for example, "need 5 WildFly servers and 1 MySQL server running". Kubernetes self-healing mechnisms, such as auto-restarting, re-scheduling and replicating containers then ensure this state is met. The user just define the state and Kubernetes ensures that the state is met a all times on the cluster.

## How is it related to Docker
Docker provides the lifecycle management of containers. A Docker image defines a build time representation of the runtime containers. 
Kubernetes uses `Docker` to pacakge, instantiate, and run containerized applications.

## Kubernets cluster
Below is a high-level logical block diagram for Kubernetes:

## Key concepts of Kubernetes
* Pods are scheduled to `Nodes` and contain a group of co-located `Containers` and `Volumes`.
 
	Containers in the same Pod share the same network namespace and can communicate with each other using localhost. 
	
	Pods are considered to be ephemeral rather than durable entities.

* Label is a key/value pair attached to Pods and convey user-defined attributes. 
	
	For example you might create a `tier` and an `app` tags to tag your containers by applying label (tier=frontend, app=myapp) to your frontend Pods and labels (tier=backend, app=myapp) to backend Pods. 
	
	You can then use `Selector` to select Pods with particular Labels and apply `Service` or `Replication Controller` to them.

* Replication Controller ensure the specified number of `Pod` replicas are running at any one time. 

	If you create a Replication Controller for a Pod and specified 3 replicas, it will create 3 Pods and continueously monitor them. 

	If one Pod dies then the Replication Controller will replace it to maintain a total count of 3. 
	
	If the Pod that died comes back then you have 4 Pods, consequently the Replication Controller will terminate one to keep the total count is 3. 
	
	When creating a Replication Controller you need to specify two things

	* 	Pod Template: the template that will be used to create the Pods replicas.
	* 	Labels: for Pods that this Replication Controller should monitor.

* Services

	Serivce is an abstraction that defines a set of Pods and a policy to access them.
	
	Services find their group of Pods using Labels. Because Services are abstraction you don't usually see them in diagram which makes the concept hard to understand.
	
	Now imagine you have 2 backend Pods and you defined one backend Service named `backend-service` with label selector (tier=backend, app=myapp). Service backend-service will facilitate two key things:

	* A cluster-local DNS entry will be created for the Service so your frontend Pod only need to do a DNS lookup for hostname `backend-service` this will resolve to a stable IP address that your frontend application can use.
	* So now your frontend has got an IP address for the backend-service, but which one of the 2 backend Pods will it access? The Service will provide transparent load balancing between the 2 backend Pods and forward the request to any one of them. This is done by using `kube-proxy` that runs on each Node.
	* There is a special type of Kubernetes Services called `LoadBalancer`, which is used as an external load balancer to balance traffic between a number of Pods. Handy for load balancing Web traffic for example.

* Nodes

	A node is a physical or virtual machine that acts as Kubernetes worker, used to be called Minion.
	
	Each node runs the following key Kubernetes components:
	* Kubelet: the primary node agent
	* kube-proxy: used by Service to proxy connections to Pods.
	
* Kubernetes Master

	Kubernetes Master provides a unified view into the cluster and has a number of components such as Kubernetes API server. 
	
	The API server provides a REST endpoint that can be used to interact with the cluster.
	
	The master also includes the Replication Controllers used to create and replicate Pods.
